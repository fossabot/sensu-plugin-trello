# Sensu check for new incidents in Trello

Checks for cards in a trello list. If cards are present, the check returns 
_CRITICAL_, containing name and date of last activity of card. When more 
than one card is present, all card names and dates are returned with *;* 
delimiter.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trello-incidents'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trello-incidents

## CONFIGURATION
Configuration of API key and API token should be done through the sensu 
settings file located in _/etc/sensu/conf.d/_. 
      
_api_key_ and _api_token_ can be obtained from [Trello](https://trello.com/app-key). 
_list_ can be obtained by adding _.json_ to a card in the browser in the 
list that should be monitored and search for _idList_ in the JSON-output.
Note that in a production environment, _api_key_ and _api_token_ should be 
specified in the Sensu settings rather than through CLI parameters. 

## USAGE
Check if a specific trello list is empty or contains cards
